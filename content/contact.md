The best way to contact Haiku, Inc. is by emailing our [public mailing list](https://www.freelists.org/list/haiku-inc) ([archives](https://www.freelists.org/archive/haiku-inc)). You are encouraged to engage us publicly, as it provides the community at large an opportunity to participate and suggest points that may otherwise be overlooked.

If a discussion is occurring on another public mailing list and one of the Board of Directors have not responded, send an email to the public mailing list, as it is possible for the on-going discussion to have gone unnoticed. For example, due to a higher volume or simply being a list to which none of Haiku, Inc.'s members are subscribed to. Also from time to time, the members of Haiku, Inc. 's Board of Directors may be available in the #haiku channel on [OFTC](https://oftc.net/). 

For private matters that require confidentiality, the following address may be used: **contact ( a ) haiku-inc ( . ) org**
