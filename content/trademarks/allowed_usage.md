## Overview

This is a basic summary and explanation of how the trademarks may be used (remembering to comply with the Usage Requirements).

If your usage case is not listed, then you need to [Contact Haiku, Inc.](/contact) and receive permission. As the need arises, new uses may be added to this list.

## Freely distribute official releases

Original official releases (eg, R1/Beta 1 but not "nightly images") may be redistributed.

As a distributor, you need to comply with the various source code licenses that are used within Haiku(R).

Additionally, we believe it is in everybody's interest to distribute the newest release and encourage you to do so.

If you are interested in becoming an official mirror, please [contact us](/contact).

## Personal use

Only for yourself and your friends (meaning people from whom you don't receive anything of value in return). Giving away as a 'Thank you' while collecting donations or other finances is not considered personal use.

## Showing support for the Project

  * The marks should always link to www.haiku-os.org or haiku-os.org
  * Note: using the HAIKU Marks as a 3rd party logo is not allowed

## As part of a notice that your product incorporates or is designed for Haiku

  * Note: no impression of endorsement should be implied nor expressed without prior permission

## Domain names

Provided that the website clearly states

* It is a community operated site.
* The official project homepage is haiku-os.org - as an example, have a footer of:

> Haiku(R) and the HAIKU logo(R) are registered trademarks of [Haiku, Inc.](http://haiku-inc.org) and are developed by the [Haiku Project](http://haiku-os.org)."

Note: using the HAIKU Marks as a 3rd party logo is not allowed

## Derivative Logos

The main HAIKU logo may not be used in the creation of derivative logos. However, the HAIKU Leaf and the HAIKU Background Leaf logos may be used in the creation of derivative logos. This will hopefully balance the need to protect the trademark and the desire to create derivative graphics that have a strong visual connection to the Haiku Project.

Derived logos must always be sufficiently different from the HAIKU logo to allow the community to tell the difference. For example, if you want to create a derived logo for a local Haiku user group, you might be able to insert the HAIKU Leaf logo or HAIKU Background Leaf logo graphic into the local group's name in a way that does not cause confusion. But confusingly similar derived logos are not allowed. This includes entwining HAIKU logos with other logos, or connecting them together in a confusing manner. See [Incorrect Logo Usage](/trademarks/logo_design#incorrect-logo-usage) for visual examples.
