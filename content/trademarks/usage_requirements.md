# Usage Requirements
The following requirements apply to all uses of the HAIKU Marks. Each specific usage case of the HAIKU Marks may have additional requirements to be fulfilled.

## First Use
The first use of "Haiku" should include "®" or "&#40;R&#41;". The HAIKU logo shall be accompanied by "®" or "&#40;R&#41;)". The HTML for the ® symbol is "&amp;reg;"

## Proper Name
The proper name is simply "Haiku". The name is not "HaikuOS", "Haiku OS", nor "Haiku Operating System". It is encouraged to use a verbose introduction, such as "Haiku, an open source operating system". This informs the reader what Haiku is and maintains the integrity of the trademark.

## Attribution
The following message must be included, either on the same page or along with other attributions on a seperate page, such as a 'legal statements' :

"Haiku® and the HAIKU logo® are registered trademarks of Haiku, Inc. and are developed by the Haiku Project".

If this message appears on a networked hypertext document such as a webpage:

* "Haiku, Inc." shall be a hyperlink to "http://www.haiku-inc.org"
* "Haiku Project" shall be a hyperlink to "http://www.haiku-os.org"

If this is a non-hypertext document or printed material, the document must clearly convey that website of Haiku, Inc. is www.haiku-inc.org and the official website of the Haiku Project is www.haiku-os.org.

## Non-confusing
The use of the logo must be clear in its purpose. The viewers of the material must be able to easily determine

whether you are an official representative of the Haiku Project | Haiku, Inc. or an independant user group (or another entity)
whether money raised goes to Haiku, Inc or to an independant user group (or another entity)

## Within Good Taste
As an analogy, acceptable use would be comparable to movie content that is "Safe for all ages (Rated G)" and not one that is rated "XXX" nor "NA-17". Usage outside the bounds of good taste includes but is not limited to: any manner that disrespects others (be it persons or other projects), obsence, or defamatory.

## Indemnification
By using the HAIKU Marks, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Haiku, Inc. and its members against any and all claims by third parties arising from the use of these trademarks.

## Graphical Modifications
There are two different policies regarding how the graphical logos can and cannot be modified. In short, the HAIKU logo® should generally be viewed as read-only; however, the HAIKU Leaf and HAIKU Background Leaf allow more modifications and alterations. See Incorrect Logo Usage for visual examples.

## HAIKU logo

You may resize the logo provided that:
* The aspect ratio is maintained
* A size greater than 150 x 50 pixels is used
* When using a logo with a transparent background, to use the correct logo
  * **Dark background:** White wordmark
  * **Light background:** Black wordmark
* All other modifications are not allowed
* Cannot pair the logo with external elements to create the appearance of another visual entity (eg "<HAIKU logo> News")

## HAIKU Leaf and HAIKU Background Leaf

In essence, the only graphical editing restrictions for the HAIKU Leaf and HAIKU Background Leaf are to:

1. Maintain the original aspect ratios
2. Not create confusingly similar derivative logos.

These are some of the allowed modifications for the HAIKU Leaf and HAIKU Background Leaf:

* Resize the logo (provided that the aspect ratio is maintained)
* Crop or otherwise omit portions of the logo
  * example: Deskbar graphic
  * example: Haiku User Guide banner graphic
* Alter the colors, even to match the leaves in the HAIKU logo
* Rotate the logo
* Apply filters, such as Gaussian Blur
* Create new derivative logos, which are distinguishable from the HAIKU logo
